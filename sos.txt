I've added code to compute strength of offense, defense,
schedule, and home advantage for every NCAA from
2002-2012. It pools divisions I, II and III across those years
and estimates pool strength for offense and defense relative
to D1. The model estimates game pacing for each game
separately as a random effect (both teams in the same
game are subject to the same game pacing).

The most interesting results are the rankings and the relative
strength of divisions ("current_ranking.txt" and
"division_ranking.txt" is the "sos" directory).

str = team strength
ofs = team offensive strength
dfs = team defensive strength
sos = strength of schedule

It's a multiplicative model using points, so you have this
approximate relationship to win probability (on a neutral court):

win prob ~ (team_str^14)/(team_str^14 + opponent_str^14)
